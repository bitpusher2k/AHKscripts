# KeyUtility.ahk - By Bitpusher/The Digital Fox

## v3.3 last updated 2024-04-05

## AutoHotKey macro script collection which provides several useful functions as keyboard shortcuts.

### Scripts provided as-is. Use at your own risk. No guarantees or warranty provided.

## Usage:

Modify keyboard shortcuts as desired - https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/Hotkeys.htm.  
Compile with AHK into exe and set to start with Windows to have functions available each session.  

AHK v1.1 has been what I've been using for years. Scripts were pretty simple, so AHK v2 version is also now included.

Precompiled EXEs of the scripts are also included - Though you should not trust strange macro executables you find on the internet.

Included functions:  

1. Text expansion of several useful abbreviations, including "ttt" for time, "ddd" for date, and "dddd" for date-stamp (use "::abbreviation::TEXT TO EXPAND TO" format to add your own).
2. CapsLk -> Triggers PowerShell clipboard image resize script (from UtilityScripts).
3. Shift+CapsLk -> Go up a directory level in Windows Explorer.
4. Ctrl+Win+ Up/Down/Left/Right -> PageUp/PageDown/Home/End.
5. Ctrl+Win+a -> Launch "Everything" search program.
6. Ctrl+Win+s -> Cascade all windows (an option that used to be present in the Windows 10 taskbar right-click menu).
7. Ctrl+Win+z -> Move the active window to near the top-left corner of the main screen (especially handy for windows that are lost off the edge of the screen).
8. Ctrl+Win+x -> Move the active window to near the top-left corner of the main screen, set the width to 1300, and set the height to 800 (preferred Explorer window size).
9. Ctrl+Win+c -> Move the active window to near the top-left corner of the main screen and set width/height to be a bit smaller than the screen.
10. Ctrl+Win+v -> Textâ€“only paste from clipboard.
